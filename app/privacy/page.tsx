              Omven collects information to provide better services to its users and to better understand visitors to its websites and their interests. Omven collects information in the following ways:

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300">
              <li>Information you actively choose to submit to us (such as your name, email address, company name, title, country) for the purpose of accessing various downloads, viewing specific content, subscribing to Omven Strategy newsletters, registering for events, and your preferences in receiving marketing from Omven and its third-party partners, as well as your communication preferences. Information we have obtained about you from publicly available sources such as social media, marketing platforms, or events you attended. You will receive marketing communications from Omven if you have requested information from Omven or you or your employer has purchased services from Omven;</li>
              <li>Information Omven receives from your use of Omven websites, such as IP address, browser type, ISP, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, number of clicks, domain name, and country/state of all visitors to Omven's websites;</li>
              <li>Location information when you use Omven websites, as Omven may collect and process information about your location. Omven uses various technologies and tools to determine location;</li>
              <li>Information considered aggregated data, such as statistical or demographic data, which Omven may use for any purpose. Aggregated data may be derived from your personal information but is not considered personal information in law as it does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity, unless Omven combines or connects aggregated data with your personal information so that it can directly or indirectly identify you;</li>
              <li>Omven collects technical data from various third parties and public sources, such as:

              Other than as required by law, Omven websites do not collect any special categories of personal information about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic and biometric data). Omven will not collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.

              Omven will only use your personal information for the purposes for which it was collected, unless it reasonably considers that it needs to use it for another reason that is compatible with the original purpose. If Omven needs to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, Omven will notify you and explain the legal basis which allows Omven to do so.

              If your personal information is protected by EU data protection law, Omven's legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which Omven collects it.
            </p>
            <p className="text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              However, Omven will normally collect personal information from you only (a) where it needs the personal information to perform a contract with you, (b) where the processing is in its legitimate interests and is not overridden by your rights, or (c) where it has your consent to do so. In some cases, Omven may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.

              Any information collected by Omven will be done in accordance with this Privacy Policy for the purposes of making better business decisions, supporting the activities you choose to engage in, and providing higher quality solutions and services to Omven Strategy customers. Omven uses your location information to tailor your experience with Omven websites. It may also use any non-personal information collected to enhance Omven websites, and your IP address for website diagnostics and administration. Omven will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes it was collected for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
            </p>
            <p className="text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
              To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, Omven considers the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which Omven processes your personal information and whether it can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

              Omven processes information on servers in many countries around the world, and you consent to your personal information being processed on a server located outside the country in which you reside. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective). However, Omven has taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy, including utilizing the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between its group companies, which requires all group companies to protect personal information being processed from the European Economic Area to an equivalent standard to that required under European Union data protection law.

Omven has put in place procedures to deal with any personal information breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach when legally required to do so.

              If your personal information is protected by EU data protection law, you have the following data protection rights which you may be able to exercise by contacting Omven using the contact details provided under the "Contact Details" heading below:

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300">
              <li>If you wish to <strong>request deletion</strong> of your personal information, you can do that in the settings of your profile on Profile.omven.com.</li>
              <li>If you wish to <strong>access, correct, or update</strong> your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting Omven.</li>
              <li>In addition, you can <strong>object to processing</strong> of your personal information, ask Omven to <strong>restrict processing</strong> of your personal information, or <strong>request portability</strong> of your personal information by contacting Omven.</li>
              <li>You have the right to <strong>opt out of marketing communications</strong> that Omven sends you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the "unsubscribe" or "opt-out" link in the marketing emails Omven sends you or by using the relevant opt-out mechanism for non-email-based marketing.</li>
              <li>Similarly, if Omven has collected and processes your personal information based on your consent, then you can <strong>withdraw your consent</strong> at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing Omven conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</li>
              <li>You have the <strong>right to complain to a data protection authority</strong> about Omven's collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.</li>

              You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, Omven may charge a reasonable fee or refuse to comply with your request if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Omven tries to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally, it may take longer if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, Omven will notify you and keep you updated.
