              If your personal information is protected by EU data protection law, Green Giant Energy's legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which Green Giant Energy collects it.
            </p>
            <p className="text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              However, Green Giant Energy will normally collect personal information from you only (a) where it needs the personal information to perform a contract with you, (b) where the processing is in its legitimate interests and is not overridden by your rights, or (c) where it has your consent to do so. In some cases, Green Giant Energy may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.

              Any information collected by Green Giant Energy will be done in accordance with this Privacy Policy for the purposes of making better business decisions, supporting the activities you choose to engage in, and providing higher quality solutions and services to GGE customers. Green Giant Energy uses your location information to tailor your experience with Green Giant Energy websites. It may also use any non-personal information collected to enhance Green Giant Energy websites, and your IP address for website diagnostics and administration. Green Giant Energy will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes it was collected for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

            <p className="text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
              To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, Green Giant Energy considers the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which Green Giant Energy processes your personal information and whether it can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

              Green Giant Energy processes information on servers in many countries around the world, and you consent to your personal information being processed on a server located outside the country in which you reside. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective). However, Green Giant Energy has taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy, including utilizing the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between its group companies, which requires all group companies to protect personal information being processed from the European Economic Area to an equivalent standard to that required under European Union data protection law.

              <li>In addition, you can <strong>object to processing</strong> of your personal information, ask Green Giant Energy to <strong>restrict processing</strong> of your personal information, or <strong>request portability</strong> of your personal information by contacting Green Giant Energy.</li>
              <li>You have the right to <strong>opt out of marketing communications</strong> that Green Giant Energy sends you at any time.

              <li>Similarly, if Green Giant Energy has collected and processes your personal information based on your consent, then you can <strong>withdraw your consent</strong> at any time.

              You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, Green Giant Energy may charge a reasonable fee or refuse to comply with your request if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Green Giant Energy tries to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally, it may take longer if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, Green Giant Energy will notify you and keep you updated.
